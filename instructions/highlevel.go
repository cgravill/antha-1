// (i.e. wrapped in CommandInst (see trace.go)), and are sometimes
// called "high-level" instructions. These are ultimately the inputs
// to calls to Device.Compile. Do confuse these with the Inst
// interface in lowlevel.go - those are for the results of
// Compilation... Yes, this is a dreadful situation and needs to be
// addressed.
